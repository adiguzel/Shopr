Provides the user with interactive explanations for recommendations and her preferences. Just a research project based on [UweTrottmann's Shopr](https://github.com/UweTrottmann/Shopr)!

A human analogue of *interactive explanations*: Imagine one of your friends explains that she recommends you a blue shirt because she thinks you like the color blue. You could correct her saying that you don't like blue but are interested in green instead. Then you would except a new suggestion.
